# Mercari-Price-Suggestion-Challenge

Mercari is a Japanese e-commerce website which allows users to sell/buy things which one doesn't use, thus helping to earn some cash from it.<br/>
So in the Mercari App, users can choose whatever price they want while listing an item but sometimes the items cannot be sold as the listing prices could be too high as compared to the market price or conversely when the listing price is less than the market price the customers can lose out.<br/>
So in the Challenge hosted by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mercari-price-suggestion-challenge), we need to built an algorithm that will automatically suggest/recommend a suitable Price for the product listed by the user.<br/>
